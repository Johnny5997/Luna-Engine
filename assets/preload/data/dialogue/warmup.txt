:johnny:hey! welcome to the VS Luna mod
:johnny:to start you off, heres a brand new tutorial level, which can get you used to how many arrows youll need to press!
:johnny:trust me... your keyboard might break......
:johnny:another few things to keep in mind, later on in the mod you may encounter new mechanics, aswell as modcharts
:johnny:the modcharts are nothing but trouble... watch out for them...
:johnny:also, if the voices desync from the instrumental, pause and unpause the game
:johnny:i know, its not practical. but we're working on a fix for it
:johnny:anyways, glhf!!!
