KYS is missing due to me losing it, sorry about that.
Luna's meow sample is for the Sampler plugin. Open FL Studio, add a Sampler instrument, and drag in meow.ogg

Plugins required to load some of these songs properly:
Boyfriend DirectWave Instrument: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zzrk9QplR9zu3mCDbfIy-IVKAIF5g6rS/view?usp=sharing
EZdrummer 2 (Used in Insanity and Splitathon, uses a whole gigabyte of memory so make sure your pc can handle that)
Serum (Used in Corntheft for those heavy leads you hear)
reFX Nexus (Used in Corntheft for basses and pads)
Kontakt Loader + Orchestral Essentials (Used in maze for the staccato backing)
Valhalla DSP Pack (Used in unfairness for that weird bitcrush effect on the drums, also used in maze for the snares)

samples for songs will be included
